        <h1>Basics of Silversmithing</h1>
        <p>Silvermithing is a fairly simple process to learn. After learning the basics it is <strong>easy to get creative</strong> and create unique beautiful pieces. There are a few main steps when creating a piece: Design, cutting of materials, soldering, lapidary grinding, pickling, polishing, setting stones, and burnishing. There are many slightly different methods to this process such as different flux solutions, differen polishing techinques etc. that create the same outcome. Most silversmiths use semi precious stones to create their pieces. However <a href="aboutseaglass.html#sign">seaglass</a> rings have become increasingly popular. Since sea glass come in <em>many shapes and sizes</em>, it is a fun material to use to create unique pieces. Since seaglass is a bit more fragile, its best to start off using harder stones that are less likely to be damaged/scratched when first learning.</p> 
        <p>Lets go over the basics. All of these steps can be viewed in the video below the tool list. First things first you will need to cut your metal. Cut out a bezel (the cup to hold your stone in place), sheet metal plate for the backing of your ring, and a band. Next up solder your bezel. Line of the two ends of your bezel so they are touching perfectly, then aply flux, hard solder, and fire your bezel. Dip it in the water to cool and adjust your bezel to fit your stone/seaglass. Flatten your base plate sheet using the raw hide mallet and anvil. Then paint the base plate with flux, set your bezel in the center of the sheet, and line the inside with medium solder. Fire with the torch until solder flows and connects the bezel the the sheet. Now that you bezel is connected use your lapidary system and shave off the rest of the sheet off, so you have a seamless connected between your bezel and sheet. 
            </p>
        <p> Now that you have a nice bezel cup that fits your stone we will work on your band. Round out you band using your mandrel and raw hide mallet. You should round it fully and leave a 1/4 inch gap between the two ends (this will be where we lay out solder to attatch the band). Paint the back side of you bezel cup with flux, clamp your band into your third arm clamp and line it up so its centered on the bezel cup. Apply flux, easy solder, and fire until solder flows beneth band. Dip in your jar of water to cool it off. Check your piece for any holes or gaps, you will need to fill them at this point. </p>
            
        <p>Now that we are done firing we will place your ring into our pickling acid. This will take off all the discoloration and flux residue. Leave it in the warm acid bath until the piece is completely white. Its time to polish! Press your piece into the polishing wheel and rotate it to cover all sides. Once completely shiny, scrub with water.</p>
            <p>Time for final steps. Apply E6000 glue inside you bezel cup and set your stone inside. Using the burnishing tools close the gap between the stone and bezel. Pressing the bezel in tight and flush will assure your stone/seaglass never falls out. YOU'RE ALL DONE. Last step is to admire your piece and show it off to all your friends. Great work you are now a silversmith! Once you have made a couple pieces you can move on to more advanced pieces with SEAGLASS. This is only the beginning, good luck. </p>
